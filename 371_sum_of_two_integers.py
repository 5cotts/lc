# # If the variable has a signed integer type, a program may make the
# # assumption that a variable always contains a positive value. An integer
# # overflow can cause the value to wrap and become negative, which violates
# # the program's assumption and may lead to unexpected behavior (for example,
# # 8-bit integer addition of 127 + 1 results in âˆ’128, a two's complement of 128).
# # (A solution for this particular problem is to use unsigned integer types for
# # values that a program expects and assumes will never be negative.)
# # 
# # There are 127 possible bytes for a a positive 32 bit int.

#             # (a & b) << 1 represents the carry left over from the above summation.

#             # First iteration (a is 20, b is 20)
#             # 10100 ^ 10100 == 00000 # makes a 0
#             # (10100 & 10100) << 1 == 101000 # makes b 40
